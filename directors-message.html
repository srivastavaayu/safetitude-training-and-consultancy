            No human endeavor is free of hazards that affect the well-being of
            humanity in particular and flora and fauna in general. The
            ever-changing technology along with processes, incorporation of
            newer machinery, tools, and tackles, and use of a variety of raw
            materials and chemicals all alone or in a combination have put
            challenges before business owners/managers to conduct the business
            without harm to workers, deterioration to environment and damage to
            property in case of fire. In such a situation, Health and Safety
            must be a fundamental aspect of managing an organization as it has
            impacts on all the functions within the organization, just as
            quality, cost, production might. Accidents in course of project or
            operation render an organization lose brand, trust, profits,
            reputation, and whatnot.
            <br /><br />
            On the other hand, good Health and Safety management is a sure and
            certain way to gain in business so as to register a continuous
            growth of it. So, ensuring safety at the workplace is not a choice
            but pre-requisites to run a business successfully through meeting
            its goals.
            <br /><br />
            Safetitude is a unique approach to safety wherein programs and
            strategies are designed, implemented, established and sustained in
            order to reduce the inventory of workers at-risk-behaviors (ARBs)
            and increase the inventory of Safe Behaviors(SBs) ultimately to
            arrive at minimum level of risk to run a business.
            <br /><br />
            As a Chemical Engineer, Diploma in Industrial Safety (RLI-K), PG
            Diploma in Pollution Control and Management (APSU), Grad-1 in Fire
            Engineering (IFE, Delhi), and an MBA, having 30 years of ample
            rewarding career in the core function of HSEF in reputed corporates,
            now the journey begins to helping the industry to raise the bar of
            HSEF performance. It shall remain my endeavor to make HSEF an
            integral part of the business to ensure safety to workers and
            protection to environment.
