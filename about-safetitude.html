            The organization came in existence solely out of passion. It could
            take shape as a result of long-prevailing thoughts to earn allegory
            of safety by doing something innovative in these fields. It is
            intended to share with the society what has been gained over the
            years working in the industry of various sizes and scales. The
            longing to know to the bottom of the concept of the things has
            rewarded in form of confidence that I am ready to move ahead. I hope
            this tiny step will prove to be a giant leap in times to come and
            will stand on its own firm feet.
